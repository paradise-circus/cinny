## Local development
> [!TIP]
> We recommend using a version manager as versions change very quickly. You will likely need to switch between multiple Node.js versions based on the needs of different projects you're working on. [NVM on windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades) on Windows and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on Linux/macOS are pretty good choices. Recommended nodejs version is Iron LTS (v20).

Execute the following commands to start a development server:
```sh
npm ci # Installs all dependencies
npm start # Serve a development version
```

To build the app:
```sh
npm run build # Compiles the app into the dist/ directory
```
